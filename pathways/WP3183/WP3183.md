description: 'Model depicting mesodermal specification based on the literature and
  highly enriched gene expression profiles via comparison across dozens of independent
  induced and embryonic pluripotent stem cell lines, following differentiation to
  multiple lineages (ectoderm, mesoderm, endoderm, embryoid body). The underlying
  genomic data can be obtained from:  https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn1773109'
