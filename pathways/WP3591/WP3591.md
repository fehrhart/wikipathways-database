description: This is currently not a pathway but a list of sleep related genes and
  proteins. The source for this information is the gene ontology. The genes and proteins
  were filtered for "sleep" annotation (taxon = homo sapiens). According to supplementary
  information they were clustered in major (neurotransmitters, hormons, appetite regulation
  and immune system) and minor groups.
