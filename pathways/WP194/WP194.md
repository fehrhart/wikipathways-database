description: 'Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids phenylalanine, tyrosine, and
  tryptophan proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway
  branches (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  One branch proceeds to phenylalanine and tyrosine,
  and the other to tryptophan (CITS:[Jones]). The phenylalanine and tyrosine branch
  has one reaction in common, rearrangement of chorismate to prephenate, at which
  point, the pathway branches again to either phenylalanine or tyrosine (CITS:[1943992])).
  S. cerevisiae, similar to E. coli, synthesize phenylalanine and tyrosine via the
  intermediate 4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate and phenylpyruvate, respectively, while some
  other organisms synthesize them via arogenate (CITS:[1943992]).  Aromatic amino
  acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition,
  activation of enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  The
  carbon flow through the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and
  the branching points by the terminal end-products. The initial step of chorismate
  biosynthesis can be catalyzed by two isoenzymes Aro3p or Aro4p, whereby Aro3p is
  inhibited by phenylalanine, and Aro4p by tyrosine (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  The
  first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine
  and activated by tryptophan (CITS:[1943992]).  The transcriptional activator GCN4
  regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes;
  however, no GCN4 regulation was found for ARO7 of the phenylalanine and tyrosine
  and branch, TYR1 of the tyrosine branch, or TRP1 of the tryptophan branch (CITS:[1943992]).  SOURCE:
