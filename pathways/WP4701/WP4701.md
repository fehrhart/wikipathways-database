description: Monoterpenes (C10) are the major group of compounds within the essential
  oils of the mint (Lamiaceae) family. Peppermint (Mentha × piperita)is considered
  a model system for the study of monoterpene metabolism, which main steps are depicted
  in this pathway.   This pathway is annotated well enough for data analysis, however
  please do not add the "Approved Version" tag yet, since this allocates the PW to
  the incorrect species (grape vs mint). The WikiPathways team is working on a solution.
