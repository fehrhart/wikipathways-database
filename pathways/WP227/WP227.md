description: 'Osteoblasts are specialized, terminally differentiated uninucleated
  cells responsible for bone formation. Their activity is tightly regulated by external
  stimuli, originating from e.g. the parathyroid glands, osteocytes, etc. Along with
  osteoclasts, which are responsible for bone degradation, osteoblasts are key regulators
  of the shape and volume of bone tissue. '
