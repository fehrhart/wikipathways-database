description: 'Pathway depicting synaptic transmission of neurotransmitters from the
  presynaptic nerve terminal to the synaptic cleft upon depolarization. Synaptotagmin
  mediated transport along the nerve cell cytoskeleton indicates the initial step
  of this process. Originally created by Joanna S. Fong and Nathan Salomonis in the
  Bruce Conklin laboratory 5/12/2000 for use in GenMAPP. Genes associated with neurotransmitter
  reuptake from the synaptic left were obtained from the Gene Ontology term GO:0001504.
