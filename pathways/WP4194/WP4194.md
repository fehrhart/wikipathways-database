description: This pathway shows the regulation and action of the GH-IGF-1 axis. Chondrogenesis
  in the growth plate is the biological process that drives height gain. The Growth
  hormone (GH) insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) axis is one of many regulatory
  systems that control chondrogenesis. Other hormones (estrogens, androgens), paracrine
  factors, extracellular matrix molecules and intracellular proteins regulate the
  activity of growth plate chondrocytes as well. Estrogen is critical for epiphyseal
  fusion in both young women, as well as men. This pathway describes how the growth
  plate lengthens until the epypheseal plate closure occurs. GH is released by the
  anterior pituitary gland due to the GRH. This activates IGF-1 in muscles and bones,
  and promotes lengthening of the growth plate. Also, GnRH in the hypothalamus stimulates
  LH and FSH in the anterior pituitary which stimulate gonads to produce sex hormones,
  such as estrogen.
