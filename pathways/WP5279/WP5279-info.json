    "description": "Mineralocorticoid synthesis and metabolism, which produce adrenal steroid hormones from cholesterol. These hromones regulate sodium retention in the kidneys and are therefore essential in sodium balance, intravascular volume, and blood pressure [PMID:8839934].  The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from William Griffths.  Metabolic reactions currently without a Rhea ID have been added in bold to the pathway model.",
