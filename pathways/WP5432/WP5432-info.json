    "description": "Omega-3-polyunsaturated fatty acids may help with cellular senescence and other age-related conditions: Cognitive decline, Inflammation, Telomere shortening, DNA damage, and Epigenetic changes. Omega-3s are mainly found in fish and other seafood. However, most people in the world have low levels of EPA and DHA in their blood.
