description: Globoseries sphingolipid biosynthesis taken from Sphingomap. Solid conversion
  arrows are documented according to Sphingomap. Thicker lines are those reactions
  not found in Rhea. Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either not occurring or
  undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a pathway to the final
  glycolipid) p Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted.  Metabolites with
  a dotted box are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the
  final product as several different routes could occur.
