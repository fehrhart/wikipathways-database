    "description": "This pathway provides an overview of the directed differentiation molecules used to induce early and derivative cell lineages from human pluripotent stem cells. This overview differentiates between the three primary germ cell layers (ectoderm-outer layer, endoderm-inner layer, mesoderm-middle layer), which are formed in the earliest state of embryonic development and give rise to different tissue types. The initial version of this pathway is a direct adaptation of the SnapShot \"Directed Differentiation of Pluripotent Stem Cells\" pathway authored by Luis A. Williams, Brandi N. Davis-Dusenbery, and Kevin C. Eggan, HHMI, Harvard University, Cell 149, May 25, 2012 Elsevier Inc. DOI 10.1016/j.cell.2012.05.015. http://download.cell.com/pdf/PIIS0092867412005946.pdf. This adaptation was generated by Meenakshi Venkatasubramanian and Krithika Ramasamy Subramanian at Cincinnati Children's Hospital in the laboratory of Nathan Salomonis.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2848 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
