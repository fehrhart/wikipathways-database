description: 'Specific families of pattern recognition receptors are responsible for
  detecting microbial pathogens and generating innate immune responses. Toll-like
  receptors (TLRs) are membrane-bound receptors identified as homologs of Toll in
  Drosophila. Mammalian TLRs are expressed on innate immune cells, such as macrophages
  and dendritic cells, and respond to the membrane components of Gram-positive or
  Gram-negative bacteria. Pathogen recognition by TLRs provokes rapid activation of
  innate immunity by inducing production of proinflammatory cytokines and upregulation
  of costimulatory molecules. TLR signaling pathways are separated into two groups:
  a MyD88-dependent pathway that leads to the production of proinflammatory cytokines
  with quick activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK, and a MyD88-independent pathway associated
  with the induction of IFN-beta and IFN-inducible genes, and maturation of dendritic
  cells with slow activation of NF-{kappa}B and MAPK.  Source: [http://www.genome.jp/kegg-bin/highlight_pathway?scale=1.0&map=map04620&keyword=toll-like
