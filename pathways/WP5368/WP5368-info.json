    "description": "The intratumoral production of estradiol-17beta (E2) from circulating steroid hormone precursors plays an essential role in estrogen-related breast and epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). There are two possible pathways producing E2, one being the sulfatase pathway starting from estrone sulfate, and one being the aromatase pathway which starts with DHEA-S. Both routes rely on two crucial enzymes: STS for estrogen activation and SULT1E1 for inactivation. Research indicates that an increased STS expression and E2 production is associated with cancer progression. However, sulfonation of E2 via SULT1E1 not only reduces proliferative effects of estrogens on hormone-sensitive tumor cells, but also generates water-soluble estrogen sulfates consequently leading to an increased excretion of sulfonated E2. This helps preventing a metabolic activation of the hormone into potentially mutagenic catechol metabolites. Thus, targeting estrogen-modifying enzymes is a potential endocrine therapy strategy for patients with estrogen-sensitive EOC.  This pathway is based on Figure 1 from: Mungenast, F., Aust, S., Vergote, I., Vanderstichele, A., Sehouli, J., Braicu, E., Mahner, S., Castillo\u2011Tong, D.
