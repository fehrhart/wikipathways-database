description: 'This pathway demonstrates autophagy upregulation during pancreatic ductal
  adenocarcinoma (PDAC). It covers autophagy accumulation as well as how this promotes
  cell proliferation in tumor microenvironment. Autophagy in PDAC affects mTOR signaling
  pathways as well as MAPK signaling pathway. '
