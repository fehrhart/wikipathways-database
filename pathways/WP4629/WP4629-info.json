    "description": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. This pathway was made during a research project at the UMCG, concerning changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg Effect. It is an extended version of the glycolysis pathway (WP534), and is descriptive of the content that is provided in the computer model of Shestov et al (2014). A second version, containing the content of the model itself as well as the corresponding supplement and article, can be found here [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP4628]  This pathway was uploaded to provide a high resolution version to readers of the thesis. Description and pathway adapted from [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP534] Referred article: Shestov et al., 2014 [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227]",
