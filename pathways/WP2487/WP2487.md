description: This pathway is an NAD salvage pathway which proceeds via the intermediate
  nicotinamide riboside (N-ribosylnicotinamide, or NR). While the presence of this
  pathway has been suggested for several organisms including Escherichia coli [Kurnasov02],
  it is of particular importance to Haemophilus influenzae and other V-factor-dependent
  members of the Pasteurella family. These organisms lack the enzymes necessary for
  the de novo synthesis of NAD, as well as most of the enzymes for the more common
  NAD salvage pathway, and therefore require exogenous NAD supply in the form of one
  of the V-factor compounds, which include NADP, NAD, NMN, and NR. However, only the
  non-phosphorylated V factor, NR, can be transported across the inner membrane into
  the cytoplasm, where it can be converted to NAD and NADP [Kurnasov02]. Thus this
  pathway is critical for these organisms [MacInnes90].  Since NAD+, which is obtained
  from extracellular sources, is highly polar, it has to be hydrolyzed before it can
  be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane for final uptake. A key enzyme in
  this pathway is a periplasmic protein that hydrolyzes NAD+ to nicotinamide mononucleotide
  (NMN), and hydrolyzes NMN to nicotinamide riboside (NR) [Kemmer01]. The nicotinamide
  riboside thus formed is transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm,
  where it is it is converted back to NMN, and eventually, to NAD+.  The identity
  of the NR transporter has not been confirmed experimentally, but it is suggested
  that it is encoded by the pnuC gene, although earlier work with the PnuC protein
  of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium suggested that it encodes the transport
  of NMN [Liu82, Kemmer01].  NADP+ is recycled in the same manner, following dephosphorylation
  to NAD+. In H. influenzae, this dephosphorylation is performed by the outer membrane
  glycoprotein e (P4), encoded by the hel gene.  While the pathway is predicted to
  be present in Enterobacteriaceae, it probably serves a minor role compared to de
  novo biosynthesis and the main NAD salvage cycle (NAD salvage pathway I). Some of
  the enzymatic activities associated with this pathway have been described in Enterobacteriaceae
  as early as 1951 [Rowen51], but it was only recently that the genes responsible
  for them were identified. Surprisingly, several activities were found to be functions
  of the multifunctional protein NadR, which was initially believed to have a role
  in regulation only [Raffaelli99, Kurnasov02].
