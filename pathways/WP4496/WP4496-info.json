Pathway based on Biocarta pathway (M12095). https://cgap.nci.nih.gov/Pathways/BioCarta/h_il1rPathway  IL-1 signals primarily through the IL-1 receptor type 1 (IL-1R1). Through expression of cytokines such as TNF, TGF-beta and interferons, IL-1 holds a range of inflammatory activities that include induction of fever, expression of vascular adhesion molecules and roles in arthritis and septic shock. IL-1 binds to the respective IL-1 receptor however, it requires the IL-1 receptor accessory protein (IL-1RAP) to transduce a signal. Two kinases (IRAK-1 and IRAK-2) get activated through IL-1 binding to its receptor. Via these kinases a cascade gets activated which includes TRAF6, NF-kB activation and c-JUN activation. The IL-1 signaling cascade represents a highly conserved response to pathogens. ",
