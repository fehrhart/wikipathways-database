    "description": "Axon guidance forms neuronal networks. Axons are guided by factors including netrins, ephrins, Slits, and semaphorins. These guidance cues interact with growth cone receptors, and downstream signal transduction pathways converge onto Rho GTPases which change in cytoskeletal organization.  Those cytoskeletal changes determine which way the growth cone will turn. This pathway is derived from https://www.kegg.jp/entry/map04360.",
