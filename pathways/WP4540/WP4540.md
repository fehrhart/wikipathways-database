description: Hippo signaling and the activation of YAP1/TAZ transcription is regulated
  by many other pathways (green labels) and factors. For example, the activation of
  SMAD and Beta catenin/TCF/LEF via TGF-beta signaling and WNT signaling pathways,
  respectively, enhanced the transcription of YAP1/TAZ target genes. This enhanced
  activity induces more aggressive  phenotypes of malignant mesothelioma cells such
  as cell proliferation, invasion, and epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT). This
  pathway was created based on figure 2 from Sekido et al. Phosphorylation sites were
  added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus, www.phosphosite.org.
