description: Young and environmentally enriched exosomes deliver functional miR-219
  that impacts oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination. Schematic illustration
  of the involvement of miR-219 in oligodendrocyte differentiation.  Upon exposure
  to nutritive exosomes, neural stem cells preferentially enter the oligodendrocyte
  lineage due to the inhibition of the proneurogenic factor NeuroD1. miR-219 also
  suppresses expression of a number of other factors that inhibit OPC differentiation,
  such as PDGFRα, a receptor for a mitogenic factor that promotes proliferation and
  prohibits differentiation. Finally, miR-219 decreases levels of ELOVL7, a regulator
  of lipid metabolism whose over-activity could lead to demyelination.
