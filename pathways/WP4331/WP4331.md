description: Neovascularisation (aka new vessel formation) is a crucial process related
  to wound healing. It supplies oxygen and nutrients to, and carries waste from, damaged
  tissue. Angiogenesis is a subpart of Neovascularisation, being a vital process in
  growth, development and wound healing.
