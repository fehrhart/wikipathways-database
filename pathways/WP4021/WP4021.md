description: A simple model of the Fgf and Wnt gene network in the zebrafish tailbud.  Fgf
  signaling inhibits transcription of the Wnt inhibitors dkk1 and notum1a. PI3k signaling
  activates the Wnt pathway by phosphorylating (inactivating) Gsk3β. Phosphorylation
  of Gsk3β also leads to an increase in active Erk levels, suggesting Wnt signaling
  promotes Mapk activity. Fgf and Wnt have opposing effects on transcription of co-regulated
  genes, which include Fgf (spred3) and Wnt (dkk1, notum1a) inhibitors. (From Stulberg
  et al)
