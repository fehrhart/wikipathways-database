    "description": "Interleukin-18 (IL-18) is a member of the IL-1 family of cytokines and was initially described as an IFN-ÃŽÂ³-inducing factor derived from anti-CD3-stimulated Th1 cells. IL-18 plays a significant role in the activation of hematopoietic cell types mediating both Th1 and Th2 responses and is the primary inducer of interferon-ÃŽÂ³ in these cells. The biological activity of IL-18 is mediated through its binding to the IL-18 receptor complex (IL-18R) and activation of nuclear factor-kB (NF-kB), culminating in the production and release of several cytokines, chemokines, and cellular adhesion molecules. In certain cell types, IL-18 also activates mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) and PI3K/AKT signaling modules leading to the production and release of proinflammatory cytokines. IL-18 mediated signaling acts as one of the vital components of the immunomodulatory cytokine networks involved in host defense, inflammation, and tissue regeneration. ",
