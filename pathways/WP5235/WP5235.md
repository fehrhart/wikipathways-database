description: 'Porto-sinusoidal vascular disease (PSVD) is a rare disease (Schouten
  et al., 2015), affecting less than 1 in 2000 citizens (European standard) (Griffon
  et al., 2016). It is characterized by signs of presinusoidal portal hypertension
  without cirrhosis, where the cause of the hypertension is unknown (Lee et al., 2016;
  Schouten et al., 2011). Based on that what is known about the etiology of PSVD,
  its development can be categorized into five groups: immunological disorders, chronic
  infections, exposure to medications or toxins, prothrombic conditions, and genetic
  predisposition (Schouten et al., 2015). In practice, the disease has multiple contributing
  factors (Siramolpiwat et al., 2016).   This pathway describes a mutation in the
  KCNN3 gene that is hypothesized to result in genetic predisposition to PSVD (Koot
  et al., 2016). PSVD has also been referred as idiopathic non-cirrhotic portal hypertension
  (INCPH), hepatoportal sclerosis, incomplete septal cirrhosis, obliterative portal
  venopathy, partial nodular transformation, non-cirrhotic portal fibrosis, nodular
  regenerative hyperplasia (NRH), and idiopathic portal hypertension (Schouten et
  al., 2015; Siramolpiwat et al., 2016; Besmond et al., 2017).'

  - ' About:'
  - ' Calcium-induced activation of the SK3 channel will cause hyperpolarization of
    endothelial cells, resulting in hyperpolarization of the adjacent muscle cell,
    which is also known as an endothelium-derived hyperpolarizing factor (EDHF). This
    hyperpolarization of the muscle cells will then result in dilation in resistance
    arteries (Ledoux et al. 2006; Kohler et al. 2010). '
  - ' Gene transcription:'
  - ' KCNN genes are expressed in neurons, epithelium, endothelium of the vasculature,
    and several types of smooth muscle. The SK3 channel, which is a gene product of
    the KCNN3 gene, is involved in vascular tone- and blood pressure regulation. '
  - ' KCa channel'
  - ' SK3 channel'
  - ' SKCa 3'
  - ' Small conductance calcium-activated potassium channel protein 3'
  - ' Small-conductance Ca2+- activated K+ (SK) channel'
  - ' The SK3 channel is important for afterhyperpolarization following an action
    potential. One channel is made from four monomers which all contain six transmembrane
    segments,  connected via a single pore loop. The N-termini and the C-termini are
    both located at the intracellular side of the membrane. A calmodulin molecule
    is located at the C-termini of the SK3 channel via a CaM-binding domain. Calmodulin
    will activate the SK3 channel upon binding of Ca2+. SK3 channels are not voltage-dependent.
    (Gu et al. 2018; Köhler et al. 1996; Weisbrod, 2020)'
  - ' The level of SK3 channel expression in endothelial cells was found to be important
    for vascular tone and blood pressure in mice. (Taylor et al. 2003)'
  - ' Two binding sites for the SP1 and SP3 transcription factors are present in the
    promotor region of the KCNN3 gene in mice. SP1 and SP3 compete to regulate the
    expression of the KCNN3 gene, influenced by the environment of the promotors.
    SP1 activates the expression of the gene, and SP3 inhibits the expression of the
    gene (Pierce et al., 2010; Xiong et al., 2020) . It was found that ERα stimulates
    the transcription KCNN3 through these transcription factors (Jacobson et al.,
    2003).'
