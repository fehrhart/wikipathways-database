    "description": "Lateral signaling targets and negative regulation of LET-23 signaling. The LIN-12/Notch pathway plays two related roles in vulval development; to prevent adjacent induced vulval precursor cells (VPCs) from both becoming 1Â° VPCs and to induce VPCs adjacent to the 1Â°VPC to take a 2Â° cell fate. See figure 14 in http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_vulvaldev/vulvaldev.pdf.",
