    "description": "\"Regulation of immune responses in the epidermis by two largely parallel pathways. The p38 MAPK pathway (proteins in this pathway are in black letters) regulates the expression nlp-29, an AMP-encoding gene. A second AMP, encoded by cnc-2, is regulated by neuronally expressed dbl-1 that actives TGFb pathway (blue letters) in the epidermis. The identity of the neurones and whether G-protein signalling is required for neuronal secretion of DBL-1 is not known.\"",
