description: 'In biochemistry, eicosanoids are signaling molecules made by oxidation
  of twenty-carbon essential fatty acids, (EFAs). They exert complex control over
  many bodily systems, mainly in inflammation or immunity, and as messengers in the
  central nervous system. Source: [[wikipedia:Eicosanoid|Wikipedia]].  This pathway
  is inspired by the Lipidmaps>Eicosanoids pathway [https://lipidmaps.org/resources/pathways/vanted.php].
  For Homo sapiens, the information from this pathway has been integrated with the
  pre-existing pathway at [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP167|WikiPathways].'
