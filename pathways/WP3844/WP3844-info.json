    "description": "This pathway is based on figure 1 from Merritt et al. (See Bibliography). The PI3K-AKT-mTOR signaling pathway has been shown to have a significant correlation with the development of castration-resistant prostate cancer. The signaling pathway regulates many cellular processes such as protein synthesis, proliferation, survival, metabolism, and differentiation, all factors that would increase a cancerous cell's ability to survive. Scientists have explored the use of various inhibitors for different parts of the signaling pathway, and have been faced with varying success.    Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3844 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
