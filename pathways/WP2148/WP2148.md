description: Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is a growth factor found in
  the central and peripheral nervous systems. BDNF binds to two well-characterized
  receptors, TrkB and p75 (aka, low-affinity nerve growth factor receptor) to influence
  neuronal cell survival and differentiation. In the hippocampus, BDNF activity is
  also implicated in learning and memory.
