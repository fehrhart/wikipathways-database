description: As a general rule, most prokaryotes utilize the aspartate de novo pathway,
  in which the nicotinate moiety of NAD is synthesized from aspartate [Begley01],
  while in eukaryotes, the de novo pathway starts with tryptophan [Panozzo02] (NAD
  biosynthesis II (from tryptophan)).  The first attempt to elucidate a prokaryotic
  pathway to NAD was reported by Ortega and Brown in 1960 [Ortega60]. They implicated
  (incorrectly) glycerol and a dicarboxylic acid as precursors in the synthesis of
  the pyridine ring of NAD in E. coli. Subsequent work by Chandler et al. [Chandler70]
  established that L-aspartate is the dicarboxylic acid precursor. Suzuki et al.,
  in 1973, established that the three carbon precursor is dihydroxyacetone phosphate
  (DHAP) and not glycerol [Suzuki73]. In addition, Andreoli et al. demonstrated that
  quinolinate was a key intermediate in this pathway [Andreoli63]. Eventually it became
  clear that quinolinate is indeed a precursor, not only in this pathway, but in all
  known NAD biosynthetic pathways.
