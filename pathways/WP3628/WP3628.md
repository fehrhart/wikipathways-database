description: In addition to the PIN family proteins that are mainly involved in the
  intercellular Autin transport via the Auxin Polar Transport pathway (WP2941) mediated
  by PIN proteins located on the plasmamembrane, the Arabidopsis PIN family members
  PIN5, PIN6 and PIN8 are located on the endoplasmic reticulum membrane/envelope.
  PIN6 is also likely co-located with the nuclear membrane. According to Sawchuk MG
  et al. (2013) PIN5, PIN6 and PIN8 play roles in leaf vein patterning.  PIN5 and
  PIN8 play an antagonistic role in regulating the intercellular auxin transport as
  well as in gametophyte (pollen) and sporophyte development.  Not much is known about
  the direction of auxin flow mediated by the PILS. However,  they help in increasing
  the free auxin amount in the cytoplasm.
