description: This pathway shows the relationship between BRAF signalling and the development
  and behavior of pilocytic astrocytoma (PA), normally induced by MAPK pathway activation.   BRAF
  is related in two alternative mechanisms in MAPK activation; first oncogenic fusion
  between SRGAP3 and RAF1 (highlighted in yellow); second a 3 basepair insertion in
  BRAF (KIAA1549, again in yellow).   This pathway is based on Figure 3" An overview
  of MAPK pathway alterations in PAs" from [https://doi.org/10.1038/onc.2009.73 Jones
  et al].
