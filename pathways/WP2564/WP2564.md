description: Sigma factors are components of the RNA polymerase complex that are responsible
  for binding to the RNA polymerase complex, promoter recognition and separating DNA
  strands. The number of sigma factors is extremely diverse between bacteria, ranging
  from three in Helicobacter pylori to 63 in Streptomyces coelicolor. M. tuberculosis
  possesses 13 sigma factors, 10 of which are from the ECF sub-family, enabling this
  bacterium to cope with various environmental conditions
