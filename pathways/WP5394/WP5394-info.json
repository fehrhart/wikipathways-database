    "description": "One of the main roles of fibroblasts is the secretion of the extracellular matrix components such as glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). This pathway describes the synthesis of GAGs precursors - five UDP-derived sugars (UDP-α-D-galactose, UDP-α-D-glucuronate, UDP-α-D-xylose, UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine, UDP-N-α-alpha-D-glucosamine). It takes place in the cytosol, where it starts with the conversion of D-glucopyranose to D-glucopyranose 6-phosphate, after which it can either proceed via a shorter or a longer path. The shorter leads to the synthesis of UDP-α-D-galactose, UDP-α-D-glucuronate and UDP-α-D-xylose, while the longer leads to the synthesis of UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-galactosamine and UDP-N-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine. Some of the enzymes are missing in the pathway and can be a subject for future research. This pathway was created based on the pathway information from the MetaCyc database (see Bibliography).  ",
