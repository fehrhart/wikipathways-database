description: Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is an umbrella
  term for 12 disease subtypes, all characterized by the build-up of iron within the
  brain. One of these subtypes is beta-propeller protein-associated neurodegeneration
  (BPAN) caused by a mutation in the WDR45 gene. This protein is involved in the autophagy
  pathway; the exact mechanism is still unknown. Other NBIA subtypes are PKAN, CoPAN,
  and FAHN. PKAN and CoPAN are involved in Coenzyme A synthesis within mitochondria
  and FAHN is found in myelin synthesis. Dysfunctioning of these pathways leads to
  a phenotype characterized by developmental delay and intellectual disabilities.
  Nevertheless, the exact relation between mutation and phenotype remains unknown.
