description: After uptake, mRNA is translated into spike protein and presented as
  cell-surface MHC-bound peptides to CD4+ and CD8+ T cells. Cytosolic sensing of RNA
  by RIG-I and MDA5 plus TLR binding within endosomes leads to activation of IFN regulatory
  factor 3/7 (IRF3/7) and nuclear factor κB (NF-κB), which bind to DNA inducing gene
  transcription, and production of IFN-I and proinflammatory cytokines, respectively
