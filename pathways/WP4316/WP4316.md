description: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short RNAs that are important for the regulation
  of numerous biological processes. Accordingly, the expression of miRNAs is itself
  tightly controlled by mechanisms acting at the level of transcription as well as
  processing of miRNA precursors. Recently, active degradation of mature miRNAs has
  been identified as another mechanism that is important for miRNA homeostasis. In
  cultured human cells, ribosomal RNA processing protein 41 (RRP41) and polynucleotide
  phosphorylase (PNPT1) degrade specific miRNAs in the 3'-to-5'direction. (Adapted
  from Großhans H. et al 2012.)
