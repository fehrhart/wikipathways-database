    "description": "Glycolysis is the metabolic pathway that converts glucose C6H12O6, into pyruvate, CH3COCOO- and H+. The free energy released in this process is used to form the ATP and NADH. This pathway was made during a research project at the UMCG, concerning changed glycolytic fluxes during the Warburg effect. It is an extended version of the glycolysis pathway (WP534), and is descriptive of the content that is provided in the computer model of the corresponding supplement, and the article of [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227 Shestov et al., 2014]. For the purposes of this WikiPathways model, the passive transport of oxygen and lactic acid into the cell is depicted using dashed arrows, which may differ from the original computer model.   This pathway was uploaded to provide a high resolution version to readers of the thesis. Description and pathway adapted from [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP534] Referred article: [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25009227 Shestov et al., 2014]",
