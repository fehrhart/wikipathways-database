description: 'The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is central to the control
  of blood pressure and the target of several types of anti-hypertensive drugs. This
  pathway depicts a simplified representation of the pharmacodynamics (PD) of RAAS-acting
  drugs including candidate genes for the pharmacogenomics (PGx) of ACE inhibitors,
  angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), renin inhibitor aliskiren and aldosterone
  receptor antagonists. Source: PharmGKB (http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA2023&objCls=Pathway)'
