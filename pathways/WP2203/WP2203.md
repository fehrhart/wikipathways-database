  title: Shared Gene Expression Between Multiple Sclerosis and Ischemic Stroke (2019)
description: 'Thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) is an IL-7-like cytokine involved
  in regulation of a broad spectrum of biological processes. The TSLP receptor complex
  consists of the IL-7 receptor alpha subunit and its unique TSLPR subunit (gene symbol
  CRLF2). TSLP can be secreted by epithelial cells upon pathogen stimulation. TSLP
  can also activate dendritic cells, CD4+ T cells and CD8+ T cells. TSLP not only
  activate the JAK/STAT pathway but also induce phosphorylation of other signaling
  molecules including PI3K/Akt, ERK1/2 and JNKs. Aberrant TSLP signaling is implicated
  in a number of the development of diseases, including asthma, atopic dermatitis,
  eosinophilic eosophagitis and acute lymphoid leukemia.  Description source: [http://www.netpath.org/pathways?path_id=NetPath_24
  NetPath]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP2203
  CPTAC Assay Portal].'
