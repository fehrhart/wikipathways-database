description: EDA protein regulation of hair follicle growth and differentiation through
  activation Nf-kB pathway occurring by binding of p65/p50 complex. The new protein
  complex of Nf-kB/p65/p50 activates Wnt and Bmp pathway inhibitors stopping induction/patterning.
  Nf-kB complex then binds with Ltb and Shh to activate pathways for growth and differentiation.
  This pathway is based on figure 4 from Cui et al.
