description: Downstream genes of RalA signaling pathways, including the Rac-family
  GTPase-activating protein RLIP (also known as RLIP76 and ralA binding protein 1
  (RALBP1)), CDC42(cell division cycle 42), RAC1 (ras-related C3 botulinum toxin substrate
  1), RAC2, RAC3, the Y-box transcription factor ZO-1-associated nucleic acidbinding
  protein (ZONAB, also known as cold shock domain protein A (CSDA)), and two subunits
  of the exocyst complex, SEC5 (also known as exocyst complex component 2 (EXOC2))
  and EXO84 (also known as EXOC8), which are involved in regulating cell proliferation,
  apoptosis and migration
