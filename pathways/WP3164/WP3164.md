description: The process of RNA-interference in eukaryotic cells. Long precursor microRNA
  (miRNA), called pri-miRNA, is cleaved by RNase III endonuclease (Drosha) into pieces
  of approximately 70 nucleotides each (called pre-miRNA) in the nucleus. Following
  transportation into the cytoplasm by exportin 5 another RNase III endonuclease (Dicer)
  cleaves it into mature miRNA segments. Degradation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and translational
  repression occurs after miRNA binds to the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC).
  Cytoplasmic long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by Dicer into small interfering
  RNA (siRNA), which is incorporated into RISC, resulting in the cleavage and degradation
  of specific target mRNA. Synthetic double-stranded siRNA is not processed by Dicer
  and directly incorporated by the RISC.
