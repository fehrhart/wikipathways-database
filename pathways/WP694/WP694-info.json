    "description": "Simplified scheme of arylamine metabolism pathway. Arylamines are N-acetylated by NAT2 in the liver, transforming them to relatively nonreactive. Alternatively, they may be N-hydroxylated by CYPIA2, transported to the bladder, and undergo O-acetylation by NATI, to form a highly reactive species.
