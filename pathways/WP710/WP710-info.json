    "description": "This is one of two pathways that deal with DNA damage. It has two central gene products (ATM and TP53) which are connected with the [[Pathway:WP707|other DNA damage response pathway]]. In this pathway there is only one source of DNA damage induction, since most DNA damage induction sources and their involvement are mentioned in the [[Pathway:WP707|first DNA damage response pathway]]. If it is not mentioned differently, the processes take place in the cell cytoplasm. The purpose of this pathway is to report more gene products and cell condition changes through the DNA damage response pathway and at the same time keep them clearly arranged.  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP710 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
