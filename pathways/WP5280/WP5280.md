description: 'Glucocorticoid biosynthesis; a very complex multistep process starting
  from cholesterol in the inner mitochondrial membrane through StAR and StAR-related
  proteins. Glucocorticoid metabolites are essential in immune system regulation through
  the glucocorticoid receptor. Most of these compounds are produces in the adrenal
  gland, however can also be produced in other tissues, e.g. skin, brain, intestine
  [PMID:32203088].   The pathway knowledge depicted in this model stems from William
  Griffths.  Metabolic reactions currently without a Rhea ID have been added in bold
  to the pathway model. '
