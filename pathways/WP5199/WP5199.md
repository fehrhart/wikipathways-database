description: 'Phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate -- also known as PtdIns(4,5)P2
  or PIP2 or PI(4,5)P2 -- acts as a central component in the process of bridge stability
  during the final steps of cytokinesis. Furthermore, PtdIns(4,5)P2 shows bidirectional
  interactions with many different metabolites such as anillin, ERM-complex. But also
  Septin2, F-actin and other depicted components visualized in the pathway are required
  to finalize cytokinesis between two sister cells. '
