description: 'Triacylglycerol (TAG) is the major lipid reserve in plants and animals.
  The assembly of TAG occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Four consecutive reactions
  are catalyzed by ER membrane bound enzymes. The two intermediates, phosphatidate
  and 1,2-diacylglycerol, are also substrates for the synthesis of membrane lipids
  glycosylglycerides and phosphoglycerides. Thus, the last step in the pathway, catalyzed
  by diacylglycerol acyltransferase, is the only dedicated step in triacylglycerol
  synthesis.  The traditional Kennedy pathway does not include the reaction (EC 2.3.1.158,
  phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase, PDAT) where phospholipid is utilized
  as the acyl donor in TAG formation. The role of the PDAT route in TAG biosynthesis
  was clearly shown in yeast[ Dahlqvist00 ]. PDAT activity in plants was demonstrated
  in a few oil seed plants including caster bean[ Dahlqvist00 ]. The caster bean seeds
  have a high content of ricinoleat in the seed oil. Ricinoleat and other unusual
  fatty acids are modified from acyl groups linked to phospholipids, and transferred
  to TAG afterwards. PDAT was proposed playing an important role in the last step.
  However, the contribution of PDAT to TAG biosynthesis in other plants is not clear.
  Overexpressing or knockout of the Arabidopsis PDAT had no effect on TAG biosynthesis[
  Stahl04 , Mhaske05 ].  The constitution of different species of saturated and unsaturated
  fatty acids at the sn-1, sn-2, and sn-3 positions of the glycerol backbone varies
  among different plants, and is determined by substrate specificities of the three
  acyltransferases involved in this pathway. The composition of distinct fatty acids
  in TAG determines the quality and property of lipids of different plants, and also
  contributes to cold temperature sensitivity of different plants.   The pathway and
