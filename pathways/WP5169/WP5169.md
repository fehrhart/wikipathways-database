description: Defects in the heme biosynthesis in a hepatocyte can result in specific
  metabolic disorders called porphyrias. These diseases can be split into two categories,
  namely acute porphyrias and non-acute porphyrias. Acute hepatic porphyria (AIP),
  variegate porphyria (VP), hereditary coproporphyria (HCP), and Doss porphyria (ALADP)
  are all part of the acute-hepatic porphyrias. This type is often associated with
  an overproduction of neurotoxic porphyrins and porphyrin precursors.   The non-acute
  porphyrias include, porphyria cutanea tarda, erythropoietic porphyria, and congenital
  erythropoietic porphyria. These diseases are instead characterised by photosensitivity
  of the skin and in severe cases liver damage, caused by porphyrins. Another type
  of porphyria are the X-linked protoporphyria diseases, which are a result of a gain
  of function mutation in the 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase 2 gene. This causes an
  accumulation of protoporphyrin IX.  The disease present in the patient is determined
  by what enzyme is affected in the heme biosynthesis pathway. This pathway has been
  constructed using chapter 33 of the book; Physician's Guide to the Diagnosis, Treatment,
  and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (first edition), by N.Blau et al (ISBN
  3642403360 (978-3642403361)).
