description: 'The secretory membrane system allows a cell to regulate delivery of
  newly synthesized proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids to the cell surface, a necessity
  for growth and homeostasis. The system is made up of distinct organelles, including
  the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi complex, plasma membrane, and tubulovesicular
  transport intermediates. These organelles mediate intracellular membrane transport
  between themselves and the cell surface. Membrane traffic within this system flows
  along highly organized directional routes. Secretory cargo is synthesized and assembled
  in the ER and then transported to the Golgi complex for further processing and maturation.
  Upon arrival at the trans Golgi network (TGN),  the cargo is sorted and packaged
  into post-Golgi carriers that move through the cytoplasm to fuse with the cell surface.
  This directional membrane flow is balanced by retrieval pathways that bring membrane
  and selected proteins back to the compartment of origin.Original Pathway at Reactome:
