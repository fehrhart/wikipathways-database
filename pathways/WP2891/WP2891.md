  title: Identification of Biological Pathways Contributing to Marbling in Skeletal
    Muscle to Improve Beef Cattle Breeding (2020)
description: Signal transducers and activators transcription (STAT) proteins are cytoplasmic
  transcription factors containing SH2 domains that bind to the activated GHR and
  become phosphorylated by JAK2. activation of the GH receptor can also initiate signal
  transduction via the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase pathway leading
  to effects on gene transcription and metabolism.GH also stimulates phosphorylation
  of the insulin receptor substrates 1,2,3(IRS-1,2,3,4)with subsequent activation
  of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) resulting in stimulation of glucose transport.
  This pathway was based on the below review articles. <br> Initiation of GH signaling
  requires that a single GH molecule binds to two GHR monomers causing receptor dimerization.
  Proper dimerization occurs by sequential binding of the receptor to a high affinity
  site in GH followed by recruitment of the second receptor to a low affinity site
  (Cunningham, Ultsch et al. 1991). However, some evidence suggest the existence of
  preformed, unliganded receptor dimers that are activated by a ligand-induced change
  in receptor conformation (Behncken and Waters 1999; Frank 2002). In accordance with
  the receptor dimerization mechanism, dose- response experiments give rise to biphasic,
  bell-shaped kinetics (Ilondo, Damholt et al. 1994). GHR dimerization and ligand-induced
  conformational change bring the intracellular receptor domains into close proximity
  whereby downstream signaling events are triggered. Receptor-associated tyrosine
  kinase JAK2 (Janus kinase 2) is activated (Argetsinger, Campbell et al. 1993) and
  phosphorylates cytoplasmic domains of GHRs on tyrosine residues, thereby creating
  docking sites for SH2 (src homology 2) containing proteins (Herrington and Carter-Su
  2001). Signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) proteins are cytoplasmic
  transcription factors containing SH2 domains that bind to the activated GHR and
  become phosphorylated by JAK2. Phosphorylated members of the STAT family homo- or
  heterodimerize and translocate to the nucleus where they bind to specific DNA target
  elements and activate gene transcription (Herrington, Smit et al. 2000). Activation
  of the GH receptor can also initiate signal transduction via the Ras/Raf/mitogen-activated
  protein (MAP) kinase pathway leading to effects on gene transcription and metabolism
  (Vanderkuur, Butch et al. 1997). GH also stimulates phosphorylation of the insulin
  receptor substrates 1, 2, 3 (IRS-1, 2, 3) with subsequent activation of the phosphoinositol-3-kinase
  (PI3K) resulting in stimulation of glucose transport (Souza, Frick et al. 1994).
