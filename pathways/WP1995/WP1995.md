description: NO (Nitric oxide) is an important signalling molecule with vasodilatory
  and anti-inflammatory effects, indicating a postive role in reducing hypertension
  and cardiovascular disease. At the same time, NO is also associated with health
  risks such as increased risk in carcinogenesis, and hypoxia in infants. It has been
  suggested that NO can also increase mitochondrial efficiency. NO can be formed from
  L-Arginine through the classic Arginine-NO-Synthase pathway, or it can be formed
  directly from dietary nitrite by deoxiginated globins.
