description: 'Pentose phosphate, phosphogluconate, or hexose monophsphate pathway
  oxidizes glucose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate and glyceraldehyde-3-P. NADP+
  is the electron acceptor. The pathways yields NADPH as well as 5, 4, and 7 carbon
  intermediaries for synthesis of nucleotides.  '
