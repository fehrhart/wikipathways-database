description: Direct reversal repair is a mechanism of repair where the damaged area
  or lesion is repaired directly by specialized proteins. It does not involve breakage
  of the phosphodiester backbone and doesn't require a reference template unlike the
  other single-strand repair mechanism.  Methylation of guanine bases is directly
  reversed by the protein methyl guanine methyl transferase (MGMT). This is an expensive
  process because each MGMT molecule can be used only once. Methylation of the bases
  cytosine and adenine  is repaired by ALKBH2 and ALKBH3.  This pathway is based on
  information from [http://repairtoire.genesilico.pl/Pathway/4/ REPAIRtoire] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base_excision_repair
  Wikipedia].
