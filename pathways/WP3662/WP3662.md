description: The pathways activated by phytochromes in Arbabidopsis thaliana de-repress
  transcription regulators important for photomorphogenesis induction by inhibiting
  COP1, DET1, and CSN directly and indirectly through HMR. The inhibition represses
  function of Cul4 ubiquitin ligases. However, HMR is also involved in degradation
  Phytochrome A in the same pathway. Phytochromes further degrade PIFs in another
  pathway through HMR activation to inhibit repression of photomorphogenesis. Interaction
  of both pathways has been proposed through inhibition of HFR1 by COP1/DET1 to increase
  protein stability of PIFs. This pathway is based on figure 3 from Chen et al.
