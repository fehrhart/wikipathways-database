description: G-protein-coupled receptor GPR40 (also known as Free fatty acid receptor
  1(FFAR1)) is a seven trans-membrane domain receptor which is predominantly expressed
  in pancreatic beta cells. It plays an essential role in fatty acid ampliï¬�cation
  of glucose induced insulin secretion. GPR40 agonists are in second phase of preclinical
  trials for treatment of diabetes because of their role in improved glucose control.    Binding
  of free fatty acids to GPR40 initiates a downstream signaling cascade which involves
  activation of a transducer protein â€œguanine nucleotide-binding protein subunit
  alpha-11â€�  (GNA11). Next phospholipase c (PLC) hormone is activated which hydrolyzes
  membrane phospholipids (such as phosphatidylinositol-4-5-biphosphate) into second
  messenger molecules inositol-1-4-5-trophosphate (IP3) and Diacylglycerol (DAG).
  IP3 initiates calcium efflux from endoplasmic reticulum and increase intracellular
  calcium concentration.  Increased intracellular calcium concentration is involved
  in activating the insulin exocytosis machinery. DAG on the other hand activates
  PKD1. PKD1 initiates F-actin remodeling and supports second phase of insulin exocytosis.
