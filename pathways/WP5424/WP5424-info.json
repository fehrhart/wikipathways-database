    "description": "Oxylipins, notably prostaglandins, are synthetized by senescent cells and then accumulate, promoting the senescent-associated secretory phenotype (Wiley et al., 2021). The prostaglandins are classified into three main groups, depending on the starting point of their biosynthesis. The serie-1-prostaglandins are derived from its precursor dihomo-Î³-linolenic acid (DGLA). The serie-2-prostaglandins and serie-3-prostaglandins are derived from arachidonic acid (AA) and eicosapentae-noic acid (EPA), respectively (Noverr et al., 2003)",
