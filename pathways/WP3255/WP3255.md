description: 'Nicotine is an alkaloid found in tobacco plants. It is a substance that
  acts as a stimulant in humans and is one of the main factors responsible for tobacco
  dependence. When nicotine enters the body, it is distributed quickly through the
  bloodstream, and it can cross the blood-brain barrier to enter the central nervous
  system (CNS). It binds to two main types of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors: the
  ganglion type and the CNS type.  In chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla, nicotine
  binds to the ganglion-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which is composed of
  alpha 3 (CHRNA3) and beta 4 (CHRNB4) subunits. By binding to the receptors, nicotine
  causes cell depolarization and an influx of calcium through voltage dependent calcium
  channels. Calcium triggers the release of epinephrine from the chromaffin vesicles
  into the bloodstream, which leads to increased heart rate and blood pressure and
  elevation of blood glucose level.  Sources: [http://www.pharmgkb.org/do/serve?objId=PA162355620&objCls=Pathway
