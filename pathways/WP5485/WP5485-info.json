    "description": "Post-COVID is the sequela disease of COVID-19, a SARS-CoV-2 infectious disease that is characterized by long-term persistent symptoms. To understand the underlying disease mechanisms of post-COVID and the role of persistent neuroinflammation herein, this pathway visualizes the direct and indirect route of SARS-CoV-2-mediated neuroinflammation, which may induce dysautonomia, a major post-COVID symptom. The direct and indirect route are subdivided in a neurological and hematological, and a neurological and humoral route, respectively.",
