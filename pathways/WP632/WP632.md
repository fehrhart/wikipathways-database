  title: Organophosphorus flame retardants are developmental neurotoxicants in a rat
    primary brainsphere in vitro model (2020)
description: Cholesterol is essential for life - it's a required for the regulation
  of membrane fluidity. Cholesterol also serves as a precursor for many other biochemical
  pathways.  Cholesterol is synthesized throughout the body but mainly in liver, intestines,
  adrenal glands and reproductive organs. Synthesis starts with the combination of
  Acetyl-CoA and Acetoacetyl-CoA. An important intemediary in the synthesis of cholesterol
  is mevalonate.  Synthesis of cholesterol is regulated by a homeostatic mechanism.
