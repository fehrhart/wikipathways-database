description: Pathway visualizing part of THC metabolism. Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol
  (THC, also named delta1-tetrahydrocannabinol), is the primary hallucinogenic constituent
  of Cannabis sativa (plant) a.k.a. marijuana. Different parts of the plant contain
  varying concentrations of THC, with leaves containing <1% to 10% THC by weight,
  and hashish, a resin prepared from the flowering tops, containing approximately
  15% THC.   This drug undergoes various transformation in the Phase I (mainly hepatic
  metabolism primarily by hydroxylation), after which several metabolites can be transformed
  via Phase II reactions (such as acyl glucuronidatization). THC possesses activity
  at benzodiazepine, opioid, and cannabinoid receptors and also exerts effects on
  prostaglandin synthesis, DNA, RNA, and protein metabolism. Furthermore, THC work
  on the two types of cannabinoid receptor that exist in the human body — CB1 and
  CB2 — and these receptors are the primary targets of endogenous cannabinoids (endocannabinoids).
  THC binds to both cannabinoid receptors. The CB1 receptor is mostly found in the
  brain, while the CB2 receptor is found in immune tissues such as the spleen, thymus,
  and tonsils (but not in the brain). Specific antagonists exist for each of the CB1
  and CB2 receptors. Cannabinoid-coupled G protein–coupled receptors are involved
  in the control of many processes, including metabolic regulation, craving, pain,
  anxiety, bone growth, and immune function.
