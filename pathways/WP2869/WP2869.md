description: 'Ribosomes are highly conserved large ribonucleoprotein (RNP) particles,
  consisting in yeast of a large 60S subunit and a small 40S subunit, that perform
  protein synthesis. Yeast ribosomes contain one copy each of four ribosomal RNAs
  (5S, 5.8S, 18S, and 25S; produced in two separate transcripts encoded within the
  rDNA repeat present as hundreds of copies on Chromosome 12) and 79 different ribosomal
  proteins (r-proteins), which are encoded by 137 different genes scattered about
  the genome, 59 of which are duplicated. The 60S subunit contains 46 proteins and
  three RNA molecules: 25S RNA of 3392 nt, hydrogen bonded to the 5.8S RNA of 158
  nt and associated with the 5S RNA of 121 nt. The 40S subunit has a single 18S RNA
  of 1798 nt and 33 proteins. All yeast ribosomal proteins have a mammalian homolog.
  PMID: 10690410, PMID: 22884264, PMID: 9421530, PMID: 9396790  In a rapidly growing
  yeast cell, 60% of total transcription is devoted to ribosomal RNA, and 50% of RNA
  polymerase II transcription and 90% of mRNA splicing are devoted to the production
  of mRNAs for r-proteins. Coordinate regulation of the rRNA genes and 137 r-protein
  genes is affected by nutritional cues and a number of signal transduction pathways
  that can abruptly induce or silence the ribosomal genes, whose transcripts have
  naturally short lifetimes, leading to major implications for the expression of other
  genes as well. The expression of some r-protein genes is influenced by Abf1p, and
  most are directly induced by binding of Rap1p to their promoters, which excludes
  nucleosomes and recruits Fhl1p and Ifh1p to drive transcription. PMID: 10409730,
  PMID: 12509467, PMID: 10542411, PMID: 2207166, PMID: 16782874  Ribosome synthesis
  is under nutrient control.  Synthesis of the four rRNAs and 79 different proteins  in
  equimolar amounts is one of the most energetically expensive cellular processes,
  and must be coordinated together.  Ribosome biogenesis requires all three RNA polymerases:
  Pol I for rRNA genes, Pol II for ribosomal protein genes, and Pol III for tRNA and
  5S RNA genes. Therefore, sensing quality and quantity of available nutrients is
  key in the regulation of ribosome biogenesis. PMID: 15489289, PMID: 18303986  Formation
  of transcription initiation complexes at the rDNA promoter depends on the association
  of RNA Pol I with the Rrn3p transcription factor, which is regulated by  phosphorylation/dephosphorylation
  of Rrn3p. During normal conditions, a surface serine patch on Rrn3p is not phosphorylated,
  enabling it to bind  RNA Pol I for efficient rDNA transcription. In stress conditions,
  the surface serine patch undergoes phosphorylation, which impairs the interaction
  of Rrn3p with RNA Pol I, repressing Pol I transcription, and thereby also reducing
  ribosome production and cell growth. The presence of glucose results in increased
  expression of RRN3. In cells treated with rapamycin, Rrn3p is subject to proteasome-dependent
  degradation, reducing the cellular amount of transcription-initiation competent
  RNA Pol I - Rrn3p complexes. PMID: 19796927, PMID: 8670901, PMID: 20421203, PMID:
  20154141, PMID: 18084032, PMID: 11717393, PMID: 14595104  Ribosomal protein genes
  and ribosomal biogenesis genes are transcribed by RNA polymerase II. The activation
  of these promoters requires the forkhead-like transcription factor, Fhl1p, the acitvity
  of which is subject to nutrient regulation via the Ifh1 activator and the Crf1 repressor.
  Under lack of stress, the TorC1 complex retains Crf1p in the cytoplasm in a dephosphorylated,
  inactive state. Upon nutrient deprivation, the PKA-responsive Yak1 kinase phosphorylates
  Crf1p, resulting in its translocation to the nucleus, where Crf1p competes with
  the Ifh1 activator to bind Fhl1p. The transcription factor Sfp1p also mediates TorC1
  regulation of ribosomal protein and ribosomal biogenesis genes. Interaction of Sfp1p
  with TorC1 reduces Sch9p phosphorylation, resulting in a negative feedback loop.  PMID:
  15620355, PMID: 19796927  Transcription by RNA polymerase III is negatively regulated
  by Maf1, a highly conserved repressor. Both the localization and activity of Maf1p
  are regulated by phosphorylation at various sites, mediated by TORC1, protein kinase
  A (PKA), and Sch9p.  In its dephosphorylated state, Maf1p binds the N-terminus of
  the Rpc160p subunit of Pol III to prevent closed-complex formation. Maf1p is maintained
  in the cytoplasm during vegetative growth via PKA- or Sch9p-mediated phosphorylation.
  Dephosphorylation allows translocation of Maf1p to the nucleus and nucleolus under
  stress conditions, which shuts down RNA Pol III transcription.Phosphorylation of
  Maf1p by CK2 occurs at promoters, which releases Maf1p from chromatin, liberating
  RNA Pol III from inhibition. PMID: 19684113, PMID: 19299514, PMID: 21383183, PMID:
