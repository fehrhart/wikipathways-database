description: Equilibrium signalling pathway for maintenance of progenitor cells in
  the lymph gland which is also affected by hedgehog protein niche signaling. Nup98
  and Bip1 proteins both necessary for Pvr gene expression. Pvr/STAT92E complex activates
  Adgf-A to break down adenosine. Break down allows for proper maintenance of progenitor
  cells in equilibrium signalling. Niche signalling includes the expression of hedgehog
  by posterior signaling center also promoting progenitor maintenance. This pathway
  is based on figure 7 from Mondal et al.
