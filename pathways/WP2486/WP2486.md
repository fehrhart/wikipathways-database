description: 'Even though NAD molecules are not consumed during oxidation reactions,
  they have a relatively short half-life. For example, in E. coli the NAD+ half-life
  is 90 minutes. Once enzymatically degraded, the pyrimidine moiety of the molecule
  can be recouped via the NAD salvage cycles. This pathway is used for two purposes:
  it recycles the internally degraded NAD products nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide (also
  known as nicotinamide mononucleotide, or NMN) and nicotinamide, and it is used for
  the assimilation of exogenous NAD+.  Since the NAD+ molecule is highly polar, it
  has to be hydrolyzed before it can be transported across the cytoplasmic membrane
  for final uptake. It does seem to be able to penetrate the external membrane, though,
  as the enzymes that break it down are found in the periplasm [Park88]. NAD+ is first
  hydrolyzed by NAD pyrophosphatase into NMN , which can be hydrolyzed further to
  nicotinamide by NMN nucleosidase. Both enzymes are periplasmic. Both NMN and nicotinamide
  can be transported across the inner membrane into the cytoplasm. Once there, nicotinamide
  is converted via nicotinate to nicotinate nucleotide, at which point the pathway
  merges with the de novo biosynthesis pathway, and continues to NAD via deamido-NAD.  There
  are several flavors of the salvage pathway found in different organisms, and even
  within the same organism. The one described above contains 6 reaction steps, and
  is often referred to as the PNC VI pathway, for Pyridine Nucleotide Cycling. However,
  there are also a four-step cycle and a five-step cycle, termed PNC IV and V, respectively
  [Foster79, Foster80]. In the PNC IV cycle, the enzyme NMN amidohydrolase (also called
  NMN deamidase) converts NMN (which can be transported across the inner membrane
  in Enterobacteria) directly to nicotinate nucleotide, bypassing the enzymes nicotinamidase
  (PncA) and nicotine phosphoribosyl transferase (PncB), which are members of the
  PNC VI cycle. PNC IV is the major intracellular recycling pathway in E. coli [Hillyard81],
  while PNC VI is the major cycle of Salmonella typhimurium [Foster80].'
