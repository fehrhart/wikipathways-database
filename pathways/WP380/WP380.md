description: 'Pyridoxal phosphate (PLP) is the active form of vitamin B<sub>6</sub>
  and is a cofactor in many reactions  of amino acid metabolism. Pyridoxine (PN),
  pyridoxamine (PM), pyridoxal (PL),  pyridoxine 5''-phosphate (PNP) and pyridoxamine
  5''-phosphate (PMP) are all forms of  vitamin B<sub>6</sub> that can be converted
  to PLP via the PLP salvage pathway.  Most unicellular organisms and plants can synthesize
  PLP, whereas mammals cannot and require vitamin B<sub>6</sub> in their diet.  Thus
  far, three PLP biosynthetic pathways have been characterized: the de novo PLP biosynthesis
  pathway as characterized in <I>Escherichia coli</I> (CITS: [12686115]), the de novo
  PLP biosynthesis pathway as being studied in fungi (CITS: [15483325],[14764090]),
  and the PLP salvage pathway (CITS: [15483325], [17696614],[8764513],[9537380]).
  <I>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</I> synthesize PLP via the fungal type de novo PLP synthesis
  pathway and the PLP salvage pathway (CITS: [7896706], [17696614], [15483325], [14764090]).
  Extracellular PN, PL and PM are transported into the cell by Tpn1p, a member of
  the purine-cytosine permease family (CITS: [12649274]).  SOURCE: SGD pathways, http://pathway.yeastgenome.org/server.html'
