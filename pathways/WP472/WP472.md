description: 'Chorismate is an intermediate in the synthesis of the aromatic amino
  acids tyrosine, phenylalanine, and tryptophan and the vitamins, p-aminobenzoate
  and p-hydroxybenzoate (CITS:[Jones]). The series of reactions to chorismate, called
  the shikimate pathway, are common for all of the aforementioned compounds, at which
  point the pathway branches (CITS:[Jones][1943992]). One branch proceeds to tryptophan,
  one to phenylalanine and tyrosine, one to p-aminobenzoate, and one to p-hydroxybenzoate
  (CITS:[Jones][ 1943992]).  Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S. cerevisiae is
  controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of enzyme activity,
  and regulation of enzyme synthesis (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  The carbon flow through
  the pathways is regulated primarily at the initial step and the branching points
  by the terminal end-products.  The initial step of chorismate biosynthesis can be
  catalyzed by two isoenzymes, one of which (ARO3) is inhibited by phenylalanine,
  and the other (ARO4) by tyrosine (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  The first step in the
  phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine and activated by
  tryptophan (CITS:[1943992]), and the first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback
  inhibited by tryptophan.  The transcriptional activator GCN4 regulates most of the
  genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes.  SOURCE: SGD pathways,
