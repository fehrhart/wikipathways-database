    "description": "Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase, also known as δ-secretase, is a key player in a number of neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's or ALS. The enzyme can get activated in the aging brain and starts to cleave amyloid precursor protein (APP) and promotes the production of amyloid-β (Aβ). δ-secretase also breaks down tau, alpha-synuclein, SET, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, generating neurotoxic fragments and impairing their physiological processes. Each fragment has either been identified in patient samples with the relevant disease or has undergone testing to determine whether it can cause the disease pathology. This pathway is based on Figure 1 from the paper:\"δ-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanisms, regulators and therapeutic opportunities. Published by Zhang Z, Tian Y, Ye K.",
