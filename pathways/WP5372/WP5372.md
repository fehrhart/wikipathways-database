description: 'Mammalian asparagine endopeptidase, also known as δ-secretase , is a
  key player in a number of neurodegenerative illnesses, including Alzheimer''s, Parkinson''s
  or ALS. The enzyme can get activated in the aging brain and starts to cleave amyloid
  precursor protein (APP) and promotes the production of amyloid-β (Aβ). δ-secretase
  also breaks down tau, alpha-synuclein, SET, and TAR DNA-binding protein 43, generating
  neurotoxic fragments and impairing their physiological processes. Each fragment
  has either been identified in patient samples with the relevant disease or has undergone
  testing to determine whether it can cause the disease pathology. This pathway is
  based on Figure 1 from the paper:"δ-secretase in neurodegenerative diseases: mechanisms,
  regulators and therapeutic opportunities. published by Zhang Z, Tian Y, Ye K.'
