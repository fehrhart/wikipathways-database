    "description": "In most organisms, the primary mode of fatty acid catabolism is oxidation. The oxidation cycle catalyzes the complete oxidation of a fatty acid molecule, removing two carbon atoms (in the form of acetyl-CoA) with each turn of the cycle. The subcellular location in which oxidation occurs varies by organism; in bacteria, oxidation occurs in the cytoplasm, whereas in mammalian cells it occurs in both the mitochondria and the peroxisome. In contrast, oxidation in S. cerevisiae, plants, and most other fungi occurs exclusively in the peroxisome.  Description from [https://pathway.yeastgenome.org/ YeastPathways]",
