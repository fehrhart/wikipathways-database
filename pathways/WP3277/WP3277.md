description: "Oncostatin M (OSM) is a member of the multifunctional cytokine interleukin
  6 (IL6) - type cytokine family. It is mainly produced in cell types such as activated
  T lymphocytes, macrophages, monocytes, neutrophils and in microglial cells. OSM
  signaling is initiated by the interaction of the cytokine to either: the type I
  LIFR-gp130 receptor complex, or to the type II OSMR-gp130 receptor [1]. The major
  downstream signaling pathways that are activated in OSM signaling are JAK/STAT,
  Ras/Raf/MAPK and PI3K pathways [2-5]. As the receptors lacks intrinsic tyrosine
  kinase activity, associated JAKs (JAK1, JAK2, JAK3 and TYK2) phosphorylate OSM receptor
  complex and STATs (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5A, STAT5B, STAT6) [1, 6-8]. Phosphorylated
  STATs form homodimeric complexes (STAT1, STAT3, STAT5B) or heterodimeric complex
  (STAT1-STAT3) and translocate to the nucleus. Once inside nucleus STAT proteins
  bind to regulatory elements in the promoter of OSM-responsive genes and regulate
  the gene expression [1-3, 8]. Alternatively, OSM induced phosphorylation of PTPN11,
  GRB2, SHC1, Ras/Raf molecules can bring about the activation of ERK1/2 signaling
  module [1]. Oncostatin M -through ERK1/2 signaling module induces the phosphorylation
  of CEBPB, both CEBPB and EGR1 stimulates the transcription of genes involved in
  lipid metabolism [9]. Although OSM also causes induced phosphorylation in MAPK family
  members (MAPK8/9/14) the functional importance of this is at present not well understood
  [1, 11]. OSM mediated signaling cascade is negatively regulated by JAK1 inhibition
  by SOCS3 and STAT3 inhibition by PIAS3 [4-5, 10].OSM also induced the activation
  of caspase family members (CASP3, CASP7, CASP9) through the JAK2 module and regulates
  apoptosis [12-14]. In osteosarcoma cells OSM is found to mediate apoptosis through
  a less understood STAT5B signaling module [14].   1.\tO'Hara, K.A., et al., Oncostatin
