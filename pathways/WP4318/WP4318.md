description: '"The dynamics of mitochondrial fission and fusion. The localization,
  as well as some interaction and modification of the principal proteins involved
  in the two processes are shown. Once dephosphorylated, DRP1 is recruited to the
  outer membrane by FIS1 or by another, unknown, component. The oligomerization of
  DRP1 is followed by constriction of the membrane and mitochondrial fission. The
  pro-fusion proteins (MFNs on the outer membrane and OPA1 on the inner membrane)
  oligomerize to induce fusion of the membranes. Other additional components of the
  machinery are shown. BAX, BCL2-associated X protein; BNIP3, BCL2/E1B 19 kDa-interacting
  protein 3; CAMK1a, calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase 1a; DRP1, dynamin-related
  protein 1; FIS1, fission protein 1; GDAP1, ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated
  protein 1; l-OPA1, long form of OPA1; MFN, mitofusin; MIB, mitofusin-binding protein;
  MTP18, mitochondrial protein 18 kDa; OPA1, optic atrophy 1; PKA, protein kinase
  A; PLD, phospholipase D; sÃ¢â‚¬â€˜OPA1: short form of OPA1." Luca Scorrano et al
