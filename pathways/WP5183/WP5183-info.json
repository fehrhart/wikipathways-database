    "description": "Long COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease) ranges from lingering symptoms 6-12 months after contracting COVID-19 to severe implications caused by the virus. To understand the (molecular) mechanisms underlying Long COVID-19 and the potential role of chronic oxidative stress, this pathway concisely visualises mitochondrial hijacking by SARS-COV-2 leading to pro-senescent mitochondrial dysfunction and inflammation.
