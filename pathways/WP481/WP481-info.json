    "description": "Insulin signaling influences energy metabolism as well as growth. The presence of insulin signals the fed state, and this signal is passed via the AKT branch, which leads to the uptake of glucose from the blood. Other branches of the signal cascade lead to cell growth and differentiation.   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP481 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
