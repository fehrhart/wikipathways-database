    "description": "The hair follicle (HF) is the biological unit responsible for producing a single hair shaft. The follicles are arranged with concentric epithelial progenitor layers surrounding the dermal core, which is the dermal papilla (DP). Classically, the development of the follicle itself can be divided into three stages: [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2804 Induction], [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP2839 Organogenesis] and Cytodifferentiation.  Hair follicle cytodifferentiation is the third main step in hair follicle development and leads to the formation of the bulbous peg.
