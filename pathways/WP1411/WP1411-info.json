    "description": "\"Prior to fertilization, C. elegans oocytes are arrested in meiotic prophase with nuclei containing two copies of the diploid genome packaged into recombined bivalent chromosomes. The two rounds of meiotic chromosome segregation that generate the haploid oocyte pronucleus are completed in the zygote after the oocytes are fertilized. During each meiotic division, chromosome segregation is accomplished by a small acentriolar meiotic spindle that forms in the embryo anterior. During anaphase of meiosis I and again in meiosis II, the meiotic spindle associates with the cortex in an end-on fashion, and a highly asymmetric cytokinesis-like event extrudes a polar body (Figure 2; Albertson and Thomson, 1993; Clark-Maguire and Mains, 1994; Yang et al., 2003). In addition to the haploid pronucleus, the sperm brings a pair of centrioles into the oocyte, which lacks centrioles due to their degradation during oogenesis. As meiosis completes, the haploid oocyte and sperm-derived pronuclei, located at opposite ends of the embryo increase in size, becoming visible by DIC microscopy. After entering the oocyte, the sperm-derived centriole pair recruits pericentriolar material and acquires the ability to nucleate microtubules (O'Connell, 2000; Pelletier et al., 2004). Subsequently, the two sperm-derived centrioles separate, forming two centrosomes positioned on either side of the paternal pronucleus. Coincident with chromosome condensation during mitotic prophase, the pronuclei migrate towards each other. After the pronuclei meet, the nuclear-centrosome complex moves to the center of the embryo and rotates to align with the long axis of the embryo (Albertson, 1984; Hyman and White, 1987). The miotitc spindle begins to move towards the embryo posterior during metaphase (Labbe et al., 2004; Oegema et al., 2001), and asymmetric elongation during anaphase contributes to its posterior displacement (Albertson, 1984; Grill et al., 2001). Since the cleavage furrow bisects the mitotic spindle, this displacement results in an asymmetric first cleavage (For more on the mechanisms that generate this asymmetry see Asymmetric cell division and axis formation in the embryo). \"  From \"Cell division\" by Karen Oegema, WormBook",
