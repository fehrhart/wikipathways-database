description: 'This pathway is based on the figure 1 of "Genetic variation in TLR or
  NFkappaB pathways and the risk of breast cancer: a case-control study" (see bibliography).
  TLR and NFkB are important in inflammation in the body and in the cancerous cells.
  TLR signaling pathways are usually connected with MyD88 dependent pathways and MyD88
  independent pathways. TLR pathways that involve MyD88 dependent pathways such as
  this one involve IRAK complexes. The finding of TLR or NFkB genes within the body
  usually correlates with breast cancer within the person.  Proteins on this pathway
  have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP3858
  CPTAC Assay Portal].'
