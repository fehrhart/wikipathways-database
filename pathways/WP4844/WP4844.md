description: The current pathway represents the different molecular interactions that
  may occur following the dis-regulation of signaling pathways involved in adipocyte
  differentiation and proliferation which may result in the abnormal distribution
  of white adipose tissue, leading to the onset of lipodystrophic syndromes. This
  laminopathic pathway stems from mutations mainly occuring in the LMNA gene can be
  associated with the onset of other laminopathic syndromes due to a malfunction in
  the lamin A processing pathway.Other laminopathic diseases are associated with LMNA
  mutations, thus this pathway represents the overlapping interactions involved in
  such phenotypic diseases.
