description: The signaling pathway that involves insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1),
  and a variety of other components that affect the pathway, plays an important role
  in the regulation of skeletal muscle growth. The kinase Akt, or protein kinase B
  (PKB), is a central component in the pathway and is involved in both muscle synthesis,
  through mammalian target of rapmycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase kinase 3B (GSK3B),
  and muscle degradation, through the transcription factors of the FoxO family. The
  pathway also involves several feedback loops such as the negative feedback of S6K,
  phosphorylated by mTORC1, which  inhibits IRS, or the positive feedback of mTORC2,
  which is necessary to maximize the activation of Akt. A variety of other factors
  and pathways also influence the IGF1-Akt signaling pathway at various points. This
  pathway is based on figure 3 from Schiaffino et al.
