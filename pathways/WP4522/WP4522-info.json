    "description": "This pathway shows genetic disorders related to lipoprotein metabolism. Two plasmalipoproteins, LDL and HDL, and one plasma lipid, triglyceride (TG), play an important role in this pathway. Hydrophobic lipids and fat-soluble vitamins are normally transported to the site of their uptake by transporters called lipoproteins, and any deregulation of the plasma concentrations of these proteins can cause dyslipidemias. Disorders resulting from an enzyme deficiency are highlighted in pink. More details on the composition of the various lipoproteins in this pathway are visualised in [https://www.wikipathways.org/index.php/Pathway:WP3601].  This pathway was inspired by Chapter 43 of the book of Blau (ISBN 3642403360 (978-3642403361)). ",
