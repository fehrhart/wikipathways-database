    "description": "Oxidative phosphorylation is the process in which ATP is formed as a result of the transfer of electrons from NADH or FADH2 to O2 by a series of electron carriers. This process, which takes place in mitochondria, is the major source of ATP in aerobic organisms. [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21208/]   Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP623 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
