description: By summarizing published data together with our own results, this pathway
  shows a complicated relationships between transcriptional factors, miRNAs and some
  functional genes which are correlated together to generate a whole sight in early
  mouse development centered around Ptf1a, although there are some hypothetical relationships
  and the distinct development of dorsal and ventral pancreas in very early stage
  is neglected.
