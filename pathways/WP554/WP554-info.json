    "description": "The core of this pathway was elucidated over a century ago and involves the conversion of angiotensinogen to angiotensin I (Ang I) by renin, its subsequent conversion to angiotensin II (Ang II) by angiotensin converting enzyme. Ang II activates the angiotensin II receptor type 1 to induce aldosterone synthesis, increasing water and salt resorption and potassium excretion in the kidney and increasing blood pressure.  Source: PharmGKB (https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA2023)  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP554 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
