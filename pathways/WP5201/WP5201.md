description: This phospholipid biosynthesis shows a schematic overview of the major
  pathways for phospholipid biosynthesis in yeast. The mainphospholipid biosynthesis
  pathway included in this figure is;  phosphatidylcholine/phosphatidyl- ethanolamine
  (PC/PE) reacylation pathway. This figure shows the conversions and enzymatic reactions
  recquired for the PC/PE pathway.
