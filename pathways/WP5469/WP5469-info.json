    "description": "Epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is a hallmark of cancer metastasis. EMT is a process that allows epithelial cells to lose their epithelial characteristics and gain mesenchymal features, which makes them more invasive and migratory. This process is a key part of tumor progression and metastasis. EMT gives cancer cells stem-cell properties and makes them resistant to chemotherapy drugs.",
