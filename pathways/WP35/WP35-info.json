    "description": "G proteins, short for guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, are a family of proteins involved in second messenger cascades. G proteins are so called because they function as \"molecular switches\". They alternate from 'inactive' guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to 'active' guanosine triphosphate (GTP), which is a binding state, and which proceeds to regulate downstream cell processes.  Source: [[wikipedia:G_protein|Wikipedia]]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP35 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
