  title: Identification of Biological Pathways Contributing to Marbling in Skeletal
    Muscle to Improve Beef Cattle Breeding (2020)
description: The growth Hormone/Insulin-Like Growth Factor axis is a complex system
  of ligands, binding protein and receptors which the cells use for communication
  of growth simulating signal. GH is released from the pituitary and by binding to
  the GH receptor it stimulates longitudinal growth and has anabolic effects on metabolism.
  Most of the growth-promoting effects of GH are mediated by IGF-1 which is produced
  mainly in the liver after GH stimulation. IGF-1 has crucial functions especially
  for embryonic growth and development. This pathway is primarily studied to understand
  factors that contribute to growth in bos taurus(Jiang et al.)
