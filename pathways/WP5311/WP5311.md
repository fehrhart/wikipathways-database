description: Isoglobo pathway in its entirety from SPhingomap  Solid conversion arrows
  are documented according to Sphingomap.  Dotted conversions are hypothetical, either
  not occurring or undocumented (Sphingomap details all possible permutations of a
  pathway to the final glycolipid) Numbers are the sphingomap IDs, to be converted.
  Metabolites coloured red are not yet in LIPIDMAPS  Metabolites with a dotted box
  are hypothetical. These may or may not exist on the pathway to the final product
  as several different routes could occur.
