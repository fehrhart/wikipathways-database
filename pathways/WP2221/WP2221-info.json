    "description": "EGF signaling is a key pathway involved in vulval patterning. Vulval precursor cell patterning requires input and cooperation between both EGF LIN-3 graded signaling through LET-23 as well as a sequential, subordinate signal involving DSL ligands acting via LIN-12. See figure 8 here: http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_vulvaldev/vulvaldev.pdf",
