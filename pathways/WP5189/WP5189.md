description: This pathway shows copper metabolism and translocation for two cell types
  (enterocytes and hepatocytes), as well as associated disorders for transportation
  of copper to vesicles. Copper is an essential trace element required for the functioning
  of metalloenzymes. Copper is ingested through diet, absorbed by enterocytes in the
  intestinal walls, and sent to hepatocytes via the hepatic portal system.   This
  pathway model was constructed using chapter 39 of the book "Physician's Guide to
  the Diagnosis, Treatment, and Follow-Up of Inherited Metabolic Diseases (first edition)"
