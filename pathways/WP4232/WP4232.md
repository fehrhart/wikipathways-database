description: In plants, polyamines are oxidatively deaminated by copper- and flavin-containing
  odixases (CuAO and PAO) leading to the generation of H2O2 and 4-aminobutanal (ABAL)
  which can be converted to 4-aminobutyric acid (GABA). A well known neurotransmitter
  in animals, GABA plays a role in stress response in plants.
