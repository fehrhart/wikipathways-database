description: Progeroid syndromes are a group of diseases that cause premature aging
  in the affected. In this pathway, the progeroid diseases, which also show lipodystrophy
  in the affected, are in red and linked to these are the genes that are mutated for
  these diseases. These genes are specifically linked to lipodystrophy.
