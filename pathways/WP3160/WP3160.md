description: Schematic of the effects of interleukin (IL)1-beta/IL1R1 on megakaryocyte
  and platelet function. A high fat diet will cause megakaryocytes to produce platelets
  with an increase in both inflammatory and thrombotic genes.  IL1-beta in circulation
  as a result of increased body weight will bind IL1R1 on megakaryocytes. This interaction
  leads to the activation of the nuclear factor (NF)kB, PI3K/Akt, and mitogen activated
  protein kinase (MAPK) (ERK and p38) pathways. As a result, there is an increase
  in megakarycoyte maturation, including increased adhesion, increases in ploidy,
  and increases in mRNA production of inflammatory and thrombotic genes. IL1-beta
  can also bind IL1R1 on platelets and either enhance aggregation induced by agonists
  or promote adhesion and heterotypic aggregate formation.  Some of the data used
  to create the pathway was generated in mouse (noted in pathway), however the pathway
  represents human homologs of those genes.
