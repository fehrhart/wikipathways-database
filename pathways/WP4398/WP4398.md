description: Stathmin (SMTMN1) normally binds to alpha-beta tubulin heterodimers,
  but this process is negatively regulated by phosphorylation. In this way phosphorylated
  Stathmin indirectly promotes polymerization. PDGFRα dephosphorylates STMN1, which
  leads to increased tubulin depolymerization. Vinblastine inhibits polymerization,
  effectively resulting in depolymerization. During mitosis, this triggers the defense
  mechanism "spindle assembly checkpoint" (SAC), which and results in either apoptosis
  or mitotic slippage.
