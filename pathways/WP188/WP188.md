  title: Unraveling the blood transcriptome after real-life exposure of Wistar-rats
    to PM2.5, PM1 and water-soluble metals in the ambient air (2020)
description: Cell-matrix adhesions play essential roles in important biological processes
  including cell motility, cell proliferation, cell differentiation, regulation of
  gene expression and cell survival. At the cell-extracellular matrix contact points,
  specialized structures are formed and termed focal adhesions, where bundles of actin
  filaments are anchored to transmembrane receptors of the integrin family through
  a multi-molecular complex of junctional plaque proteins. Some of the constituents
  of focal adhesions participate in the structural link between membrane receptors
  and the actin cytoskeleton, while others are signalling molecules, including different
  protein kinases and phosphatases, their substrates, and various adapter proteins.
  Integrin signaling is dependent upon the non-receptor tyrosine kinase activities
  of the FAK and src proteins as well as the adaptor protein functions of FAK, src
  and Shc to initiate downstream signaling events. These signalling events culminate
  in reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton; a prerequisite for changes in cell
  shape and motility, and gene expression. Similar morphological alterations and modulation
  of gene expression are initiated by the binding of growth factors to their respective
  receptors, emphasizing the considerable crosstalk between adhesion- and growth factor-mediated
  signalling.
