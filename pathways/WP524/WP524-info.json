    "description": "The G13 subunit is an alpha unit of heterotrimeric G proteins that regulates cell processes through the use of guanine nucleotide exchange factors. G13 regulates actin cytoskeletal remodeling in cells and is essential for receptor tyrosine kinase-induced migration of fibroblast and endothelial cells.  Source: [[wikipedia:G12/G13_alpha_subunits|Wikipedia]]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP524 CPTAC Assay Portal]",
