  original gramene pathway].  Nitrogen is frequently the limiting nutrient for growth
  of many crop plants. Legumes solved this problem by establishing a symbiotic relationship
  with bacteria from the genus Bradyrhizobium, which contain the enzyme nitrogenase.
  Nitrogenase catalyzes the conversion of atmospheric dinitrogen to ammonia, which
  can be used to meet the plant''s metabolic nitrogen requirements.  Before the fixed
  nitrogen can be used by the plant, it must be converted into organic forms that
  can be transported throughout the plant and further metabolized. There are two major
  forms of organic nitrogen compounds that can be transported - amides (such as L-asparagine
  and L-glutamine ) and ureides (such as allantoin and allantoate ). Temperate-region
  legumes, such as pea, are amide exporters, while legumes of tropical origin, such
  as soybean, kidney bean, and peanut, export nitrogen in the forms of ureides. Isotope-labeling
  studies performed with tropical legumes demonstrate that ammonia produced from dinitrogen
  reduction is rapidly converted into allantoin and allantoate [ Ohyama78 ], and that
  up to 95% of the nitrogen in the xylem sap in nodulated soybeans is in the form
  of ureides [ Schubert81 ].  The ammonia generated by the bacteria is first converted
  into the amino acid L-glutamine and then incorporated into inosine-5''-phosphate
  (IMP), a purine synthesized de novo during nitrogen fixation by roots (see purine
  nucleotides de novo biosynthesis II ). '
