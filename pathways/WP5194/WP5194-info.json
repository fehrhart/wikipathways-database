    "description": "Synthesis of ceramides and 1-deoxyceramides from serine and alanine, respectively, including the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids in humans. Multiple complex sphingolipid synthesis reactions were added to improve pathway versatility. 1-Deoxyceramide synthesis shows many similarities with ceramide synthesis but has much less documentation, hence this comprehensive figure.
