description: Synthesis of ceramides and 1-deoxyceramides from serine and alanine,
  respectively, including the synthesis of complex glycosphingolipids in humans. Multiple
  more complex sphingolipid synthesis reactions were added to improve pathway versatility.
  1-deoxyceramide synthesis shows a lot of similarities with ceramide synthesis but
  does not come close in terms of documentation, hence this comprehensive figure.
