    "description": "The pathway depicted how nsp1 from SARS-CoV 2 may inhibit translation in the host cell (Yuan S et al 2020, PubMed 33188728). nsp1 protein competes with the EIF3J subunit of the EIF3s complex for binding to the 40S ribosomal subunit. The resulted 43S pre-initiation complex can no longer load the mRNA from the host cell for starting translation.",
