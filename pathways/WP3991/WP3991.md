description: Schematic representation depicts the mechanism of miR-127 in accelerating
  mesendoderm differentiation. miR-127, through the complementary pairing, suppresses
  the expression of Lefty2, which is referred to as antagonist to the nodal pathway.
  Thus, miR-127 induces p-Smad2 expression and finally up-regulates expression of
  mesendoderm markers.
