  title: Bioenergetic defects in muscle fibers of RYR1 mutant knock-in mice associated
    with malignant hyperthermia (2020)
description: Acetylcholine is an important neurotransmitter. It can be rapidly released
  in the synaptic cleft upon activation of the neuron. In the synaptic cleft the compound
  is degraded rapidly into choline and acetate, this is essential for proper neuronal
  functioning. Choline and Acetate are taken up into the cytosol and recycled for
  the next activation.
