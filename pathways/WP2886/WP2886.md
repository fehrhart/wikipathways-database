description: Synthetic biology approaches to acetaminophen production. The first reaction
  path in E.coli has been successfully tested experimentally. The second path in Synechocystis
  is proposed hypothetically by Menezes, et al. in a study considering synthetic biology
  approaches to resource utilization on future space missions.
