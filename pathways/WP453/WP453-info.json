    "description": "Inflammation is a protective response of cells to pathogens, infection or tissue damage. It involves the coordinated communication of different immune cells and blood vessels through an intricate cascade of molecular signals. Inflammation can cause fever, cardiovascular pathology, allergy anaphylaxis, fibrosis, autoimmunity, etc.  The inflammatory response has four phases: inflammatory inducers (infection or tissue damage), inflammatory sensors (mast cells and macrophages), inflammatory mediators (cytokines, chemokines, etc.) and the tissues that are affected. Each phase has many options that are triggered based on the type pathogen introduced.  In addition, chronic inflammatory conditions, where an inducer is not well defined, are becoming more common. These conditions are of particular interest because they coincide with other diseases such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, atherosclerosis, neurodegenerative diseases and cancer.
