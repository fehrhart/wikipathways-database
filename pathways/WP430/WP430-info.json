    "description": "Statins inhibit endogenous cholesterol production by competitive inhibition of HMG-CoA reductase (HMGCR), the enzyme that catalyzes conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonate, an early rate-limiting step in cholesterol synthesis. This pathway delineates genes involved in statin pharmacogenomics, including genes involved in mediating the effects of statins on plasma lipoprotein metabolism.   Sources: [https://www.pharmgkb.org/pathway/PA2031 PharmGKB] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statin Wikipedia]  Proteins on this pathway have targeted assays available via the [https://assays.cancer.gov/available_assays?wp_id=WP430 CPTAC Assay Portal].",
