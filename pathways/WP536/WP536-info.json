    "description": "Calcium is a common signaling molecule. Once it enters the cytoplasm, it exerts allosteric regulatory effects on many enzymes and proteins. Calcium can act in signal transduction after influx resulting from activation of ion channels or as a second messenger caused by indirect signal transduction pathways such as G protein-coupled receptors. Movement of calcium ions from the extracellular matrix to the cytoplasm alters membrane depolarization. This is seen in the heart, during the plateau phase of ventricular contraction. In this example, calcium acts to maintain depolarization of the heart.
