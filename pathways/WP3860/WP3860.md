description: This pathway is modeled after Figure 1 in the Article "Sugar Sensing
  and Signaling" (See Bibliography). The discovery of several new molecules such as
  HXK1 and KIN10/11 have impacted the sugar regulation within a Arabidopsis therefore
  the figure above describes our insight into the sugar sensing and signaling network,
  and several of the molecular mechanisms that are included. Energy deprivation leads
  to mobilization of starch stored in chlorophyll to provide energy for the cell.
  Gene expression of proteins involved in energy regulation for the cell is also altered.
