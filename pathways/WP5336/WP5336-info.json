    "description": "Graphene oxide has been found in the RAW264.7 to trigger a cytokine response and resulting autophagy. It was found to be mediated by  activation of TLR4 and TLR9, signalling MyD88, TRAF6, and NF-κB, resulting in cytokine expression. However, TLR signaling did not cause IFN-β expression nor IRF3 activation. The process also shows activation of Beclin 1 and LC3.",
