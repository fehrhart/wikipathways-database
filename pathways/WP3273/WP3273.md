description: 'Gene regulatory network model of cranial neural crest cell (CNCC) development,
  adaped from PMID: 19575671. Most interactions in the model are proposed to regulate
  transcription of core factors involved involved in neural crest and downstream progenitor
  specification. Transcriptional regulation arrows are proposed to promote transcription,
  unless a graphical T-bar is present at the end of the arrow (commented to be inhibitors
  of transcriptional regulation). Additional gene information was obtained from http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK53143  When
  citing thies pathway, please reference the source publication (PMID: 19575671).'
