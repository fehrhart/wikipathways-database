description: 'All lamins, except lamin C, contain a CaaX tail. This tail is comprised
  of respectively cysteine, two aliphatic amino acids and any amino acid with a COOH-terminal
  (variable). Aliphatic amino acids are nonpolar and hydrophobic and include glycine,
  alanine, valine, leucine and isoleucine. This structure acts as recognition point
  for a sequence of modifications. First the terminal cysteine is farnesylated by
  farnesyl transferase, where a isoprenyl group is added to the cysteine residue -also
  called isoprenylation. This is followed by proteolytic cleavage of the aaX part
  by Zmpste24 and methylation (CH3) of cysteine. Isoprenylation and methylation are
  both necessary for the localization of lamin A and B-type lamins in to the INM.
  Until this point processing of lamin A and type-B lamins is similar. While in type-B
  lamins the isoprenyl group remains attached to the cysteine, lamin A has a second
  cleavage site to cleave off an additional 15 amino acids upstream of the cysteine.
  This cleavage is also done by Zmpste24 and takes place at INM. When these 15 amino
  acids, 18 in total including aaX, are cleaved off mature lamin A is produced (1,2).
  Lamin processing is involved in progeria.  '
