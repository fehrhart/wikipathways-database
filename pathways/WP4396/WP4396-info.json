    "description": "Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a condition in which too much fat is stored in the liver. Nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) is a type of NAFLD marked by liver inflammation, which may progress to scarring and irreversible damage similar to that caused by heavy alcohol use.
