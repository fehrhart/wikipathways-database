description: Proposed model for the mechanism of colon cancer metastasis to the liver
  involves exporting miR-193a via exosomes sorted by major vault protein (MVP).  In
  pre-metastatic cells miR-193a suppresses mouse colon cancer progression by directly
  targeting Caprin1, which is known to positively regulate the cell cycle and cell
  proliferation. Higher levels of miR-193a in tumor cells causes of cell cycle G1
  arrest and cell proliferation repression  through reduction of Caprin1 expression.
  In metatstatic cells, increased levels of MVP leads to MVP-mediated selective sorting
  of tumor suppressor miRNA into exosomes, which promotes tumor progression.
