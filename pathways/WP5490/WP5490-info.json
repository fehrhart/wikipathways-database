    "description": "This pathway describes parallel and converging signaling pathways driven by Gαq (GNAQ) in Uveal Melanoma, and the inhibitory effects of Darovasertib and FAKi (FAK inhibitor). Key points from [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/ Arang et al]: Darovasertib is a dual inhibitor of PKC and PRK/PKN; downstream of mutant Gαq darovasertib blocks ERK and diminishes FAK activity; Darovasertib and FAKi act synergistically in preclinical uveal melanoma models.  This pathway model was developed based on Figure 7 in [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10694608/ Arang et al].",
