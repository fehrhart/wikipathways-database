    "description": "JAK-STAT signaling participates in the regulation of key biological processes in Beta-cells, including cell proliferation. Janus kinases (JAKs) serve as a fundamental switch that trigger signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT) proteins through phosphorylation, which enables downstream target activation and subsequent regulation of target gene transcription. Suppressors of cytokine signaling (SOCS) are negative modulators of JAK-STAT signaling. This pathway is based on a figure by Jiang et al. (2018, doi: 10.3892/etm.2018.6603). ",
