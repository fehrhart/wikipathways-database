description: When the Hippo-YAP pathway is in the "ON" state, YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated
  and held in cytoplasm.  When the pathway is in the "OFF" state, unphosphorylated
  YAP and TAZ accumulate in the nucleus with TEAD. This pathway was created based
  on figure 1 from Zhou et al. Phosphorylatin sites were added based on information
  from PhosphoSitePlus, www.phosphosite.org.
