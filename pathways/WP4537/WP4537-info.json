    "description": "When the Hippo-YAP pathway is in the \"ON\" state, YAP and TAZ are phosphorylated and held in cytoplasm.  When the pathway is in the \"OFF\" state, unphosphorylated YAP and TAZ accumulate in the nucleus with TEAD. This pathway was created based on figure 1 from Zhou et al. Phosphorylatin sites were added based on information from PhosphoSitePlus, www.phosphosite.org.",
