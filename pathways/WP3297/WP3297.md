description: 'Summary of reported EV release from cardiac cells in culture and their
  functional effects. EV release has been reported in numerous cell lines and primary
  cultures, both at baseline and in response to stimuli. Transfer of EVs between cell
  types has been demonstrated as well as delivery of cargo.  Note that this pathway
  represents a review of multiple studies in multiple organisms. This pathway displays
  the human orthologs.  HUVEC: human aortic endothelial cell  HMEC-1: human microvascular
  endothelial cell  HASMC: human aortic smooth muscle cell  NRVM: neonatal rat ventricular
  myocyte.   Adapted from Danielson KM, Das S. Extracellular Vesicles in Heart Disease:
  Excitement for the Future? Exosomes Microvesicles, 2014. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25429310'
