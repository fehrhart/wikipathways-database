description: The pentose phosphate pathway is a process of glucose turnover that produces
  NADPH as reducing equivalents and pentoses as essential parts of nucleotides. This
  metabolic pathway is parallel to glycolysis. It generates NADPH and pentoses (5-carbon
  sugars) as well as ribose 5-phosphate, the last one a precursor for the synthesis
  of nucleotides. While it does involve oxidation of glucose, its primary role is
  anabolic rather than catabolic. The pathway is especially important in erythrocytes.
  There are two distinct phases in the pathway. The first is the oxidative phase,
  in which NADPH is generated, and the second is the non-oxidative synthesis of 5-carbon
  sugars.
