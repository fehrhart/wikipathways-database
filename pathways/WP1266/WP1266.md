  title: Effect of VCP modulators on gene expression profiles of retinal ganglion
    cells in an acute injury mouse model (2020)
description: In this model, we provide an integrated view of Sudden Infant Death Syndrome
  (SIDS) at the level of implicated tissues, signaling networks and genetics. The
  purpose of this model is to serve as an overview of research in this field and recommend
  new candidates for more focused or genome wide analyses. SIDS is the sudden and
  unexpected death of an infant (less than 1 year of age), almost always during deep
  sleep, where no cause of death can be found by autopsy. Factors that mediate SIDS
  are likely to be both biological and behavioral, such as sleeping position, environment
  and stress during a critical phase of infant development (http://www.nichd.nih.gov/health/topics/Sudden_Infant_Death_Syndrome.cfm).
  While no clear diagnostic markers currently exist, several polymorphisms have been
  identified which are significantly over-represented in distinct SIDS ethnic population.
  The large majority of these polymorphisms exist in genes associated with neuronal
  signaling, cardiac contraction and inflammatory response. These and other lines
  of evidence suggest that SIDS has a strong autonomic nervous system component (PMID:12350301).
  One of the neuronal nuclei most strongly implicated in SIDS has been the raphe nucleus
  of the brain stem. In this nuclei there are ultrastructural, cellular and molecular
  changes associated with SIDS relative to controls (PMID:19342987). This region of
  the brain is responsible for the large majority of serotonin that is produced in
  the human body and is functionally important in the regulation of normal cardiopulmonary
  activity, sleep and thermoregulation (see associated references).  Genes associated
  with serotonin synthesis and receptivity have some of the strongest genetic association
  with SIDS. Principle among these genes is the serotonin transporter SLC6A4 and the
  serotonin receptor HTR1A. SLC6A4 exhibits decreased expression in the raphe nucleus
  of the medulla oblongata and polymorphisms specifically associated with SIDS (PMID:19342987).
  In 75% of infants with SIDS, there is decreased HTR1A expression relative to controls
  along with an increase in the number of raphe serotonin neurons (PMID:19342987).
  Over-expression of the mouse orthologue of the HTR1A gene in the juvenile mouse
  medulla produces an analogous phenotype to SIDS with death due to bradycardia and
  hypothermia (PMID:18599790). These genes as well as those involved in serotonin
  synthesis are predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by a common factor, FEV
  (human orthologue of PET-1). PET-1 knock-out results in up to a 90% loss of serotonin
  neurons (PMID:12546819), while polymorphisms in FEV are over-represented in African
  American infants with SIDS. In addition to FEV, other transcription factors implicated
  in the regulation of these genes (Putative transcriptional regulators (TRs)) and
  FEV are also listed (see associated references). In addition to serotonin, vasopressin
  signaling and its regulation by serotonin appear to be important in a common pathway
  of cardiopulmonary regulation (PMID:2058745). A protein that associates with vasopressin
  signaling, named pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (ADCYAP1), results
  in a SIDS like phenotype, characterized by a high increase in spontaneous neonatal
  death, exacerbated by hypothermia and hypoxia (PMID:14608012), when disrupted in
  mice. Protein for this gene is widely distributed throughout the central nervous
  system (CNS), including autonomic control centers (PMID:12389210). ADCYAP1 and HTR1A
  are both predicted to be transcriptionally regulated by REST promoter binding. Regulation
  of G-protein coupled signaling pathways is illustrated for these genes, however,
  it is not clear whether ADCYAP1 acts directly upon raphe serotonin neurons.   Another
  potentially important class of receptors in SIDS is nicotine. Receptors for nicotine
  are expressed in serotonin neurons of the raphe throughout development (PMID:18986852).  Application
  of nicotine or cigarette smoke is sufficient to inhibit electrical activity of raphe
  serotonin neurons (PMID:17515803) and chronic nicotine infusion in rats decreases
  expression of SLC6A4 (PMID:18778441). Furthermore, nicotine exposure reduces both
  HTR1A and HTR2A immunoreactivity in several nuclei of the brainstem (PMID:17451658).  In
  addition to CNS abnormalities, several studies have identified a critical link between
  cardiac arrhythmia (long QT syndrome) and SIDS (PMID:18928334). A number of genetic
  association studies identified functionally modifying mutations in critical cardiac
  channels in as many as 10% of all SIDS cases (PMID:18928334). These mutations have
  been predicted to predispose infants for long QT syndrome and sudden death. The
  highest proportion of SIDS associated mutations (both inherited and sporadic) is
  found in the sodium channel gene SCN5A. Examination of putative transcriptional
  regulators for these genes, highlights a diverse set of factors as well as a relatively
  common one (SP1).  Finally, several miscellaneous mutations have been identified
  in genes associated with inflammatory response and thermoregulation. Infection is
  considered a significant risk factor for SIDS (PMID:19114412). For inflammatory
  associated genes, such as TNF alpha, interleukin 10 and complement component 4,
  many of these mutations are only significant in the presence of infection and SIDS.
  In addition to these mutations, cerebrospinal fluid levels of IL6 are increased
  in SIDS cases as well as IL6R levels in the arcuate nucleus of the brain, another
  major site of serotonin synthesis (PMID:19396608). Genes such as ILR6 and ADCYAP1
  are also associated with autoimmune disorders, thus SIDS may also be associated
  with autoinflammation of autonomic centers in the brain. Regulation of thermogenesis
  by brown adipose tissue has been proposed be an important component of SIDS, given
  that SIDS incidence is highest in the winter time and that animal models of SIDS
  demonstrate variation in body temperature. Interestingly, activation of raphe HTR1A
  decreases both shivering and peripheral vasoconstriction in piglets (18094064).
  Although a putative significant polymorphism was identified in the thermoregulator
  gene HSP60, this only occurred in one SIDS case. It is important to note that in
  the large majority of all these studies, sleeping position and smoking were among
  the most significant risk factors for SIDS.   In loving memory of Milo Salomonis
