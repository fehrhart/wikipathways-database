description: 'Biosynthesis of the aromatic amino acids tryptophan, tyrosine, and phenylalanine
  proceeds via a common pathway to chorismate, at which point the pathway branches
  (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  One branch proceeds to tryptophan, and the other to tyrosine
  and phenylalanine (CITS:[Jones]).  The series of reactions to chorismate, called
  the shikimate pathway, and the series of reactions from chorismate to tryptophan
  have been found to be common to all eukaryotes and prokaryotes studied thus far
  (as reported in (CITS:[1943992])). In contrast, there appears to be two separate
  routes from chorismate to tyrosine and phenylalanine, only one of which has been
  found in S. cerevisiae (CITS:[1943992]).  Aromatic amino acid biosynthesis in S.
  cerevisiae is controlled by a combination of feedback inhibition, activation of
  enzyme activity, and regulation of enzyme synthesis (CITS:[Jones][1943992]).  The
  first step in the tryptophan branch is feedback inhibited by tryptophan, and the
  first step in the phenylalanine-tyrosine branch is feedback inhibited by tyrosine
  and activated by tryptophan (CITS:[1943992]).  The transcriptional activator GCN4
  regulates most of the genes encoding for the aromatic amino acid biosynthetic enzymes;
  however, no GCN4 regulation was found for TRP1 of the tryptophan branch, TYR1 of
  the tyrosine branch or ARO7 of the tyrosine and phenylalanine branch (CITS:[1943992]).  SOURCE:
