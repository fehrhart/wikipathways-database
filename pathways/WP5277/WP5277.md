description: 'Biosynthesis of steroid hormone precursors. The enzymes responsible
  for this process are mainly cytochrome P450 (Cyps), hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases
  (HSDs), and steroid reductases, converting cholesterol to several classes of steroid
  hormones such as glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, progestins, androgens, and
  estrogens. these reactions take place in various organs, e.g. adrenal gland, testis,
  ovary, brain, placenta, and adipose tissue [PMID:16807284].  The pathway knowledge
  depicted in this model stems from William Griffths.  Metabolic reactions currently
  without a Rhea ID have been added in bold to the pathway model. '
