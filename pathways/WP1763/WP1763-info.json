    "description": "The aim of the PluriNetWork is to give an overview of specific mechanisms associated with pluripotency in mouse. Each node represents a gene and its corresponding protein product. As stated, we intentionally focused on information flow, neglecting reactions, metabolites, intracellular movement of components, and their modifications such as protein phosphorylation Each edge can be seen as direct mechanism between its nodes. For more information, see Som A, Harder C, Greber B, Siatkowski M, Paudel Y, et al. 2010 The PluriNetWork: An Electronic Representation of the Network Underlying Pluripotency in Mouse, and Its Applications.

The PluriNetWork at WikiPathWays started with the December 2010 version.",
