description: Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway interacting with Arf/Mdm2/p53 cell cycle pathway
  to regulate cell growth and proliferation. The signalling of a mitogen acts through
  the Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway to inhibit the Rb protein and allow Myc and E2fs to
  continue into S phase and inhibits the Arf/Mdm2/p53 pathway leading to growth arrest
  or apoptosis. The Ras-Raf-MEK-ERK pathway also directly acts on the Arf/Mdm2/p53
  pathway with Dmp1 to prevent tumor formation by activating Arf. Arf inhibits Mdm2
  allowing p53 to lead the cell to growth arrest or apoptosis. This pathway is based
  on figure 7 from Sreeramaneni et al.
