    "description": "This pathway represents the core elements of Receptor Tyrosine Kinase (RTK)/Ras GTPase/MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways.  Many developmental events in C. elegans require this signaling pathway with different RTK's providing activation of the pathway in specific cell-types and under different regulatory controls. Depending on the process, this signaling pathway may interact with the Wnt,  Notch, or other pathways during development.",
